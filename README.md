We developed this app mainly by referring to the documentation of Streamlit, an open-source Python package for developing web apps (Snowflake Inc. 2024). For the Mental Health Feed, we used the publicly available code provided by Muralidhar (2023) for scraping articles from the RSS feeds of websites. Also, we referred to Alibudbud (2021) for two simple surveys that would holistically assess a student's mental health status.
