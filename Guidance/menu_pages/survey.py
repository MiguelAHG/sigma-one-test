Does it happen that you have feelings inside you would rather not feel?
Many peopleâ€”even those with strong characterâ€”sometimes feel like sad losers in certain situations. How often have you felt this way in the past?
When something has happened have you generally found that: you overestimated or underestimated its importanceâ€”you saw things in the right proportion
